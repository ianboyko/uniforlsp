Welcome! The Unifor Legal Services Plan exists to provide quality personal legal services at affordable prices to [eligible members](/post/faq/#4-who-is-eligible) of Unifor and to their spouses and dependants.

The Plan is funded by General Motors of Canada Ltd., Ford Motor Company of Canada Ltd., FCA Canada Inc., and other [corporate sponsors](/post/about/#corporate-and-union-sponsors). It is established by collective agreements negotiated between each sponsor and Unifor, and administered by an independently chaired board of trustees having equal representation from the union and the sponsoring companies.
