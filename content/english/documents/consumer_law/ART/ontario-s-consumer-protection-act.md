### CONSUMERS: BE AWARE !

Ontarioâ€™s new Consumer Protection Act, which came into effect on July 30, 2005, gives consumers better protection than in the past. All Unifor members should be aware of the following:

1. **Internet contracts** are now included under consumer protection law. Consumers must be given the opportunity to expressly accept or decline an internet agreement before it becomes valid.
2. The **ten-day cooling off period has been extended,** to cover not only door-to-door sales contracts, but also time share vacation contracts and pre-paid services (e.g. fitness clubs).
3. Some **consumer contracts must disclose certain information**. If that information is not set out in the contract, a consumer has one year to cancel the contract.
4. If the consumer goods are not delivered or services not performed within **thirty days** from the date agreed upon for delivery or performance, the consumer can cancel the contract.
5. **Any cancellation of a consumer contract must be in writing**. The effect of the cancellation is to make it as though the contract never existed.

It is important to contact a lawyer within a few days of signing the consumer contract, to be advised of your rights and to be provided with an opportunity to take advantage of your rights under the Consumer Protection Act.

##### If you enter into a consumer contract and are not sure if it is valid

##### or if you wish to cancel it

##### contact your Unifor Legal Services Plan office immediately!
