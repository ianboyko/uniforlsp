### HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

The 1986 Family Law Act created a system of property division which continued largely unchanged until the end of 2011, and remains so today, with the exception of how pensions are treated. Under the Act, pensions are specifically defined as property and required to be included in an individual’s net family property (NFP). In the years since 1986, lawyers practising in family law had struggled with the complexities of dealing with pensions. In part, this was because it was very difficult for lawyers and clients alike to accurately assess the value of an asset which could not be converted to cash and which was not to be received until some unknown point in the future and for an undetermined period of time.

In addition, further difficulties arose at the stage of settlement of an equalization entitlement. Often, the payor spouse lacked the cash to make the equalization payment, especially if the payment was in large part due to an interest in a pension, when that pension was not convertible or exigible. Many spouses felt it was unfair to have to give up an interest in a home, or otherwise use up a cash asset to meet an equalization obligation, when the obligation related to an asset they could not put their hands on.

With the passage in 2009 of Bill 133, which amended both the Family Law Act (FLA) and the Pension Benefits Act (PBA), and the promulgation of new Regulations in 2011 under the PBA, all of which came into force on January 1, 2012, a new regime began both with respect to how value is determined, but also with regard to how an equalization payment may be settled.

The new law applies to all spouses, regardless of the date of separation, unless there exists an agreement, order or arbitration award predating January 1, 2012 which resolved the issue of equalization.

In the fourteen months since the amendments came into force, there has been little judicial treatment of the new provisions, but there now exists a great deal of practical experience on the part of lawyers in implementing the new law. Questions still arise about the implication of the reforms on our practices and on the rights and entitlements of our clients. It is fair to say that the new settlement options have introduced some welcome opportunities. However, the determination of value is marked with more confusion, complexity and controversy than had been hoped.

### WHAT HAS NOT CHANGED

* Pensions remain property to be included in a spouse’s Net Family Property (NFP).
* The manner of calculating an equalization payment is the same.
* The valuation of Defined Contribution (DC), as opposed to Defined Benefit (DB) pensions is largely unchanged.
* Spouses continue to assign a value for future income tax on pension income, and that value may be inserted as a deduction in the spouse’s NFP calculation.
* Pension division continues to be subject to a (revised) 50% rule under the PBA.
* The customary practice of excluding the value of an interest under the Canada Pension Plan from a spouse’s NFP will continue, supported by a new statutory provision specifically exempting the value of CPP pensions from inclusion in NFP.

### WHAT HAS CHANGED

* The value of a DB pension interest is now calculated according to new rules.
* With certain exceptions, the value of the pension is determined by the pension plan administrator, at the request of a member or a spouse.
* The administrator may charge a fee for creating a statement of value.
* The manner of settlement of an equalization payment is governed by new discretionary rules. Therefore, the extent to which an equalization payment is funded by a cash payment or a transfer of funds out of the pension, depends
  on an individual family’s circumstances.
* Only with the consent of the pension plan, and in the case of a pension not in pay, a spouse could in theory become a member of a plan and share the pension income. However, the Regulations which have been passed do not yet contain the provisions needed to implement this.
* A pension in pay prior to separation may be divided at source and the spouse will receive a share of the income stream directly from the pension plan. Discretion appears to exist with respect to obtaining a division of income for pensions in pay.
* Existing “if and when” agreements and orders will continue to be implemented but no new such agreement or order will be enforceable if dated on or after January 1, 2012. However, it is possible to vary or amend such ‘grandfathered’ agreements and orders, to “facilitate and effect” the pension division.
* Only if the spouses consent, unmarried spouses will be able to effect a pension transfer or division, and married spouses may include a period of cohabitation prior to marriage in determining the pension’s value.

### DETERMINING PENSION VALUE UNDER THE NEW RULES

When reform was introduced, the Ontario government adopted the recommendation of the Law Commission of Ontario to standardize the determination of value along the lines of a “hybrid termination” valuation. The new method of calculating value lacks the individual customization that was previously seen, and which led to parties debating issues such as age of retirement, future indexation and (in some cases) shortened life expectancy.

In the new regime, the result is more of a “one size fits all” approach which certainly simplifies the calculation and reduces the likelihood of conflict arising between spouses.

While this approach still gives rise to some concerns regarding fairness in an individual case, a party’s ability to challenge the determination of value is largely taken away, so long as the pension plan has complied with the Regulations in calculating value.

In some cases, a solution to perceived unfairness in value lies in ensuring that the equalization payment (or at least that part of it that is referable to the pension value) is made by using the pension itself. This will be addressed in further detail in the section on Settlement.

#### New Terms:

Family Law Valuation Date: essentially the same as “Valuation Date” under the FLA

Preliminary Value: the calculation of pension value to be made by the pension plan administrator in accordance with the new Regulations

Imputed Value: that part of the Preliminary Value that accrued during the marriage (a pro–rata calculation)

Statement of Family Law Value (SFLV): the document produced by the pension plan administrator that establishes the value of the pension

#### The Prescribed Calculation

A defined benefit (DB) pension is one that promises an amount of future pension income that is determinable by years of service or other such measure. A defined contribution (DC) pension is one by which an employer promises only to contribute certain monies and to invest those monies. No guarantee is made as to future pension income.

The preliminary value of a DC Pension is simply the total of all contributions plus interest. Thus the imputed value is easy to ascertain, since it is the increase in the balance in the member’s account from the date of marriage to date of separation.

The preliminary value of a DB Pension is determined by a new formula, which determines three separate commuted values (representing three possible dates of retirement). These are then combined but with a different weight assigned to each value, depending on the “T” factor. “T” is the number of years until the member of the pension plan can take early retirement with an unreduced pension. Therefore, the greater the years of service, the more the preliminary value will be weighted towards an early retirement (i.e. higher) value of the pension. This formula is how a “hybrid-termination” value is achieved.

Rules along the above lines exist for hybrid plans, those that are a combination of DB and DC pensions.

The mortality tables used will now be unisex, so account will no longer be taken of the different life expectancies of men and women.

The pension administrator will also place a value on the spouse’s survivor benefit where the parties separate after retirement. The value of the survivor benefit is an asset (sometimes one of considerable value) of the spouse and must be included in the spouse’s NFP.

#### Some Pension Values Are Not Included in the SFLV

It is essential to note that not every component of a pension will necessarily be included in the value calculated by the administrator, and the following is a list (which is not necessarily exhaustive) of interests we must be especially alert to:

* pensions which are not governed by the PBA (but are regulated by other jurisdictions);
* additional voluntary contributions (these are to be disclosed but not included in the statement of family law value);
* non-guaranteed (ad hoc) indexing ( to be disclosed for the three years prior to separation, but not included in value);
* Supplementary Pension Plans (SERPs), which are not governed by the PBA.

Each of the above requires individual attention, and sometimes expert advice.

There will still be a need for certain interests (such as SERPs) to be valued by an independent expert such as an actuary.

There is some question as to whether administrators of non-PBA regulated pensions will produce the relevant information to enable valuation pursuant to the new PBA rules (they cannot be compelled to). In any event, the new section 10.1(2) requires all non-PBA interests to be valued in accordance with the PBA although the section does make reference to “where reasonably possible” and “with necessary modifications”. If such a plan does not provide a value in accordance with the regulations, an actuary must be retained to prepare a valuation unless the administrator is prepared to value the plan using the PBA formulae.

Remember as well that each spouse is entitled to a deduction for contingent tax liabilities (see the revised definition of NFP in s. 4(1)(a) of the FLA). These will have to be individually determined based on projected future income tax rates for the spouse with the pension.

#### Shortened Life Expectancy

One highly debated aspect of the new Regulations is that only very limited account will be taken in determining the value of a pension of a person with health issues that affect normal life expectancy. Only when the Shortened Life Expectancy (SLE) provisions of the PBA are engaged will this affect value. SLE is only available where a pension member files medical proof that death will occur within two years. A plan member who qualifies can apply to withdraw the commuted value of the pension.

SLE will affect the pension valuation only if an application for SLE is filed prior to separation, or if the application is filed within six months of separation but before the administrator receives an application for a statement of value. In this case, the physician must offer an opinion that the SLE circumstances existed on the date of separation.

This is a significant departure from the former practice whereby any spouse with a life expectancy that was significantly reduced by a health issue could make an argument, based on medical evidence, to discount the value of a pension to reflect the fact that he or she will not live to collect the full value.

Given the limited time frame of eligibility for taking into account SLE, lawyers seeing a client for the first time must immediately enquire as to whether such circumstances exist for the client or the spouse. The ill client with a pension must understand how making the SLE application might affect the spouse’s equalization entitlement. The client whose spouse is ill must be aware of the effect of the timing of the request for the pension statement.

For all other parties with significant health issues, lawyers must creatively argue the settlement options to strive for fairness of outcome.

#### Pension Plan Changes or Deficiencies in Funding

Special rules exist in a number of circumstances.

If a pension plan is being wound up in whole or in part effective prior to the date of separation, the value will be the commuted value on date of wind up, with interest to the date of separation.

If, before separation, a surplus properly qualifies for payment to members of a pension plan (and the payment has not been made by then), the value of the member’s interest in the surplus is included in the value of the pension interest.

The new rules determining value do not take account of whether a pension plan is underfunded. Underfunding may be a factor for either or both spouses or a court in determining whether or not to settle the equalization payment by a transfer of a lump sum out of the pension plan. The financial health of a pension plan can be determined by reviewing the “Transfer Ratio”, which must be disclosed in the statement of value. A Transfer Ratio is a figure that every pension plan must report to the Superintendent of Financial Institutions every three years. It may be necessary to seek professional assistance in understanding the significance of a Transfer Ratio.

Particulars of a wind up or surplus, as well of details of the Transfer Ratio, must be disclosed in the statement.

#### Advising the Client on Value Issues

The expectation underlying the new legislation was that spouses attempting to resolve the equalization of their net family properties would now be spared the costs of dueling actuaries and prolonged debates over which assumptions (e.g. date of retirement, indexation, etc.) should apply in determining the correct value to assign to the pension. These issues had frequently prevented early settlement and lead to costly trials at which each side would present expert evidence (usually the testimony of an actuary).

Under the new regime, the value of a pension is now statute mandated, and not an issue over which a judge retains the power of determination. Parties are entitled to rely on the SFLV (the statement produced by a pension plan administrator). The administrator is obliged by the PBA to calculate all of the (PBA regulated) components to value in accordance with the prescribed regulations (Regulation 287/11). The guesswork involved has been removed and replaced with a uniform method of determining value. This will inevitably lead to concerns on some clients’ parts that the value is less advantageous than they would have expected previously (some, of course, will find it more so). For example, men might claim to be disadvantaged by the fact that unisex mortality tables are now employed, since the male mortality tables used under the previous regime had resulted in lower values (this was so because statistically they do not live as long as women). Nevertheless, this does not provide a ground to challenge the SFLV.

As lawyers, most of us are not equipped to determine if a SFLV has been prepared accurately and in accordance with the regulations. Many lawyers are therefore unsure about how to advise clients. Is there room for debate as to how pension administrators ought to interpret and apply the regulations? Should the lawyer suggest a professional critique of the SFLV? Certainly in the case of high end pensions which contain components of value (e.g. Supplementary Plans) that are not regulated under the PBA, an actuary would need to be retained in any event. But for the vast majority of bread and butter pension interests, should the client be put to the expense of retaining an actuary, on top of the already hefty fee charged by the pension plan?

This choice must be put to the client, who should receive an explanation of the nature of the new mandated valuation scheme and be told that the lawyer cannot comment on the accuracy of the calculation (although the lawyer should ensure that the correct historical information – dates of birth, marriage and separation, etc. – has been imported into the report, and presumably the calculation). Not every client will wish to expend further funds on retaining an actuary to critique their own or their spouse’s SFLV, but some may.

If an actuary believes that a SFLV is not correctly calculated, the lawyer could submit that information to the pension plan, or, if that proves unsuccessful, to the pension industry regulator, the Financial Services Commission of Ontario (FSCO). This scenario is unlikely to be common, especially with the large pension plans, all of which have made considerable investment in developing sophisticated programs and systems, and in training their staff. While error is not unheard of, one would expect most of the problems to be have been detected in the first year of implementing the new law.

The value of a pension must technically be included as an asset in a party’s NFP. However, for practical reasons, it is not uncommon to remove it from the calculation where parties have agreed to divide the pension interest fully, either by means of a lump sum transfer or division of income. The remaining assets and liabilities can then be calculated to determine what other equalization entitlement exists between the parties.
