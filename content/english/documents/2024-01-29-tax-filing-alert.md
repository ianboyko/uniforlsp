* **Are you on title to property with you child or your parent?**
* **Are you on a bank account with your child or your parent?**
* **If so, you may be required to file a T3tax return for 2023.**

> *T﻿here is now a new, very broad CRA rule that seems to mandate the filing of a T3 tax return by "trustees" of "bare trusts" - i.e., where thr "Trustee" does not exercise independent discretion, and is required to follow the beneficiaries' instructions in all respects at all times. This was never requires until now.*

**H﻿ere are some examples:**

* **A﻿ Joint Account with your child or parent, worth over $50,000 at any time in 2023 or with income over $500 in 2023.**
* **O﻿n Title to Property (home, mortgage) with your child or parent.**

**Y﻿ou may want to see an accountant or tax preparer for your 2023 taxes.**

> ***N﻿OTE: It is accountants (not lawyers) who advise and assist people with filing taxes, including this new T3 filing requirement. There is no Unifor Legal Services Plan benefit coverage for filing tax returns.***
